"""
Complex Multi-Location Crisis Management Benchmark using gpt-4 LangChain Agent.

This benchmark tests a gpt-4 LangChain agent's ability to manage a crisis scenario involving
emergency supply chain management across multiple locations with severe capacity constraints
and competing priority orders.

Architecture:
- Core `InventoryManager` class handles crisis scenario business logic
- `create_inventory_tools()` creates LangChain tools for inventory operations
- `create_inventory_agent_executor()` returns enhanced AgentExecutor with state validation
- Complex multi-location state validation using `ComplexMultiLocationFinalState` schema

Crisis Scenario Features:
- Multi-priority order management (Order A, B, C with dependencies)
- Severe capacity constraints (reduced warehouse/showroom capacities)
- Strategic resource allocation across 3 showrooms and 3 warehouses  
- Partial state validation with scoring for incomplete fulfillment
- Intelligent constraint handling and priority adherence validation

Requirements:
- OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable or .env file
- LangChain and OpenAI packages: `pip install langchain langchain-openai langchain-core`
